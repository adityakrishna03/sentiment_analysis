# sentiment_analysis
This project analyzes emotions in a video by processing frames with OpenCV, detecting facial landmarks with MediaPipe, and using a pre-trained FER model. Emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger are identified and counted. A bar chart shows emotion frequency, useful for media analysis, behavioral studies, and human-computer interaction.
